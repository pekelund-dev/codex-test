# System Architecture Schematics

The diagrams below illustrate how the responsive auth web application, receipt-processing Cloud Function, and shared Google Cloud resources work together. Replace placeholder values (for example `PROJECT_ID`, `DOMAIN`, or `RECEIPTS_BUCKET`) with your real identifiers when applying the design.

## High-Level Service Topology

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph Client[Client]
        Browser[Web Browser]
    end

    subgraph DNS[Porkbun DNS Zone]
        Domain[DOMAIN (CNAME)]
    end

    subgraph CloudRun[Google Cloud Project \n(PROJECT_ID)]
        WebApp[Cloud Run Service \nSERVICE_NAME]
        Secrets[Secret Manager (optional secrets)]
    end

    subgraph SharedFirestore[Shared Firestore Project \n(SHARED_FIRESTORE_PROJECT_ID)]
        Firestore[(Firestore \nusers & receiptExtractions collections)]
    end

    subgraph Storage[Cloud Storage]
        Bucket[(RECEIPTS_BUCKET)]
    end

    subgraph Functions[Receipt Processing]
        GCF[Cloud Function \nreceipt-parser]
    end

    subgraph VertexAI[Vertex AI \n(PROJECT_ID/REGION)]
        Gemini[Gemini API]
    end

    Browser -->|HTTPS request| Domain
    Domain -->|Custom domain mapping| WebApp
    WebApp -->|Runtime SA| Firestore
    WebApp --> Secrets
    WebApp -->|Signed upload URLs| Bucket
    Bucket -->|Finalize event| GCF
    GCF -->|Download object| Bucket
    GCF -->|Parse receipt| Gemini
    GCF -->|Write parsed data| Firestore
    WebApp -->|Query receipts & users| Firestore
```

**Key points**

- The Cloud Run service and Cloud Function both use identities with the `roles/datastore.user` role against the shared Firestore project so user profiles and receipt documents live in the same database.
- Custom domain traffic (`DOMAIN`) is routed through Porkbun DNS to the Cloud Run HTTPS endpoint created by the Cloud Run domain mapping workflow.
- Secrets, OAuth credentials, and API keys should be stored in Secret Manager and referenced through environment variables rather than being hard-coded.

## Receipt Processing Sequence

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User as User
    participant CloudRun as Cloud Run Web App
    participant Storage as Cloud Storage Bucket
    participant GCF as Receipt Cloud Function
    participant Firestore
    participant Gemini as Vertex AI Gemini

    User->>CloudRun: Upload receipt (via UI)
    CloudRun->>Storage: PUT object using signed URL
    Storage-->>CloudRun: Upload success
    Storage-->>GCF: Trigger finalize event
    GCF->>Storage: Download PDF/image
    GCF->>Gemini: Request structured extraction
    Gemini-->>GCF: Parsed receipt data
    GCF->>Firestore: Upsert receiptExtractions document
    User->>CloudRun: View receipt dashboard
    CloudRun->>Firestore: Query receiptExtractions & users
    Firestore-->>CloudRun: Return documents
    CloudRun-->>User: Render combined view
```

**Notes**

- The Cloud Function and Cloud Run service share the same Firestore collections. Environment variables such as `FIRESTORE_PROJECT_ID`, `RECEIPT_FIRESTORE_PROJECT_ID`, and `RECEIPT_FIRESTORE_COLLECTION` must point to the shared project and collection names.
- The signed URL upload pattern prevents the Cloud Run service from proxying large files, while still enforcing authenticated access and storage permissions.

## Deployment & Delivery Pipeline

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Developer[Developer Workstation] -->|git push| Repo[Source Repository]
    Repo -->|Trigger| CloudBuild[Cloud Build]
    CloudBuild -->|Build container image| ArtifactRegistry[Artifact Registry]
    ArtifactRegistry -->|Image URI| CloudRunService[Cloud Run Service]
    CloudRunService -->|Serve HTTPS traffic| EndUsers[Users via DOMAIN]
```

**Operational checklist**

- The `scripts/deploy_cloud_run.sh` and `deploy-cloud-function.sh` scripts reuse the same environment configuration to keep the Firestore project, service accounts, and regions consistent.
- Cloud Build can be replaced with local Docker builds if preferredâ€”ensure the final image is pushed to a registry accessible by Cloud Run.
- After deployment, run the domain mapping workflow so `DOMAIN` resolves to the new Cloud Run service, and verify TLS certificates are provisioned before flipping production traffic.
